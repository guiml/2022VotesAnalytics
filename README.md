# TRE-RS Secoes and Zona Webscrapper

## Introduction

The initial purpose of this project was to help data analysts and data scientists to work with Brazilian electoral data. The Brazilian Authorities didn't used to release vote data with geographical information directly attached to it. But this changed in the 2022 elections when the Tribunal Superior Eleitoral started to add the location to some of their datasets. The first part of this project (notebooks 1) had the objective of creating that link, but this is not needed anymore.

On notebooks 2 onwards I already use the data from TSE with geographical information included.

## Notebooks distribution:
